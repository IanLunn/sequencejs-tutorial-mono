## Sequence.js

> The responsive CSS animation framework for creating unique sliders, presentations, banners, and other step-based applications.

Sequence.js provides all of the JavaScript functionality you need for step-based applications such as sliders and presentations, allowing you to concentrate on producing your content with style.

Easily add transitions using the `.seq-in` and `.seq-out` CSS classes automatically added via Sequence.js to style how your slides/steps and content animate.

Find out how Sequence.js works in the [Introduction theme](http://ianlunn.github.io/Sequence/) or for more details, head to the [documentation](http://sequencejs.com/documentation/).
